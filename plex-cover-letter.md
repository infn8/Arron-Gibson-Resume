# Dear Plex Team

I am a Full Stack Developer with over a decade of experience in a large variety of different roles and responsibilities. From Mom-and-Pop shops to private banks, design agencies to NFPs, projects with no budget to projects with no limits, I have seen it all. After reading your Senior Web Designer / Developer job description, I knew it would be a perfect match for me.

On a personal level I use Plex every day and I love it. I evangelize for it all the time, and I own a lifetime PlexPass and could not be happier. I have heard nothing but great things about your corporate culture and have had my sights set on being a part of your team for a number of years now.

Professionally I love Wordpress and have been working with the platform for the entirety of my career in web development. Particularly in my previous role as Director of Digital Projects with design shop Viva & Co. I was using Wordpress heavily and had many great opportunities to really test the limits of the CMS and its capabilities. I don't get the opportunity to use Wordpress in my current endeavour, so I find the opportunity to bring it back into the fold in a new role very appealing.

That covers why **I** want to work for **you**, so why should **you** want to work with **me**? First, I am a lot of fun. We're people first and foremost and adding someone to a team is a big deal. You're going to want to enjoy that experience and with me you will. I love people of all types, I am endlessly curious and I'm a quick study. Secondly, I know my stuff -- from front-end to browser inner workings, DNS, preprocessors, server stacks and beyond. That endless curiosity I possess drives me to really dive in to get a deeper understanding of all aspects of my work.

### My Portfolio

I have actually made a **custom portfolio of my work just for Plex**.  

##### What better vehicle to showcase what I could do for Plex, than Plex itself? 

Please find below a link to a **Plex Cloud Library** with brief walkthroughs of a few key WordPress projects I have done.

Pop some popcorn and have a look at some of the work of which I am most proud.

I know you must get a _lot_ of applicants and your time is valuable so if you're in a hurry I DID save the best for last.  The shows are dated chronologally and like a fine wine I get better with age so jump straight to **[Jane Gill PR - S01E05](https://app.plex.tv/desktop#!/server/ce80d4135f4145618866b7ac44a3780a/details?key=%2Flibrary%2Fmetadata%2F1920)** To see some really cool Advanced Custom Fields work.

If you have any additional questions or would like any additional information, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you for your consideration of my application, and I very much look forward to speaking with you at greater length.
