# To Whom it may concern:

I am a Full Stack Developer with over a decade of experience in a large variety of different roles and respopnsibilities.

Eveything from Mom and Pop shops to Private Banks.  Design Agencies to NFPs. No Budget to No Limits.

I have seen it all and after seeing the job description for your Senior Web Designer/Developer roll i _know_ I would be PERFECT for this job.

On a personal level I use Plex every day and I love it.  I evangelize for it all the time and I own a lifetime PlexPass and I could not be happier.  I have heard nothing but great things about your corporate culture and seeing as my wife already has a remote Web Development position the idea of being able to travel a little before our girls (2 years old and 6 months old) start school is incredibly appealing.

I also _love_ wordpress and i miss working with it.  I was using it heavily in my last position but the enterprise I am with now does not use it at all.  The ability to come bak into the fold is very appealing as well.

So that covers why **I** want to work for **you**. Now, why should **you** want to work with **me**?  Firstly, I am a lot of fun.  We're people first and foremost and adding someone to a team is a big deal.  You're going to want to enjoy that experience.  With me, you will.  I love people of all types, I am endlessly curious and a quick study.  I can provide references to attest to these claims but you'll see for yourself should you choose to grant me the privilege of an interview. Secondly I know my stuff.  From Browser inner workings, to DNS to Preprocessors, to server stacks.  I have been running my own company as my main gig since 2002.  Many of the positions on my resum√© were simply long term contracts though my company.  I have had to know it all because in many contexts I have been the only person doing any of this stuff.

I don't want to take up too much of your time and I thank you for your consideration of my application.  I very much look forward to speaking with you at greater length
